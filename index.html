                <p>It's been a journey - trust me, I didn't want to use the word &quot;journey&quot;...but truly, that's what it's been. I've been learning computer programming from the fabtastic Skillcrush, mixed with w3 schools, and lots and lots and lots of repetition.</p>
                <p>I've been learning how I learn, and slowly but surely becoming more and more confident with each week. (Not each day - there are far too many ups and downs to say each day I've improved!)</p>

            <h2>Computational Thinking</h2>
            <h6>Think like a computer...</h6>
            <p>Computational Thinking is the term used to describe what it means to think like a computer. And Computational Thinking is all about using the specific and unique capabilities of computers to solve problems. Humans have the ability to think in gray areas and feelings and make complex connecions. Computers think in terms of math and logic, 0s and 1s. Computers have a skillset, and learning to think like one (simpler) will help you know how to use it better!</p>
            <p>Computers are a funny contradiction because they are both incredibly powerful and unbelievably simple. But in order to access their power, you first need to understand their limitations. (Learning to think like a programmer.) The main limitation is that computers really only understand zeros and ones. This is really different from how our brains work. Javascript and other programming languages are like the translators between your human thoughts and what the computer understands. So what I need to do is learn how to simplify my thinking (LOL OKAY) so I can begin to speak to the computer in terms it can understand. (WILL I FINALLY OVERCOME MY CHRONIC OVERTHINKING? IS THIS THE ANSWER?)</p>

            <h2>The Four Priciples of Computational Thinking:</h2>
            <h4>Decomposition, Abstraction, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithm Writing</h4>
            <p>Before writing any code, these priciples will help you think through your problem in a computational way.</p>
            <h4>Decomposition</h4>
            <p>The process of breaking down one big problem into smaller and smaller ones until all the problems are small and easy enough to solve. Ask yourself questions to the problems you're trying to solve. This reminds me of depression and when you're trying to defeat it - break down tasks, no matter how small already into even smaller tasks. Put one foot on the floor, the other, stand up, walk to the bathroom, etc. Work up momentum!</p>
            <h4>Pattern Recognition</h4>
            <p>After breaking down your problems into smaller problems, think to see if any of your smaller problems have ny commonalities, or if you can use similar methods to solve them. Just like when you learn how something works, you may be able to repeat the process for similar things. Rinse and repeat!</p>
            <h4>Abstraction</h4>
            <p>In abstraction, the goal is to omit specific details and to focus on the general patterns (OOH this is like when starting work on a drawing or painting - abstracting it helps see the bigger picture, the bigger shapes that contain the smaller shapes and details!) In other words, my task is to solve a very simplified version of the problem you're trying to solve. In a party invitation example, you're going to send out invitations. You decide who's going to be invited, write out the addresses, prepare them to be mailed, etc. But there are certain things you don't need to know in order to send out your <strong>test</strong> invitation. You don't need to know the date, time or place. It's just a test! Just making sure it works is most important.</p>
            <h4>Algorithm Writing</h4>
            <p>In reality, writing an algorithm is much simpler than it sounds (sweet). It just means writing a series of instructions that explain how to solve a problem. Although algorithms are used a ton in computer programming, any set of instructions - A recipe, a knitting pattern, a set of instructions for how to assemble your IKEA dresser - are all algorithms we encounter every day.</p>

            <h2>5 Stages of Communicating with Computers</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>At stage 1 we have you, the human being, thinking big, complex thoughts;</li>
                <li>At stage 2 we have you, the human, learning how to think like a computer; this is called computational thinking!</li>
                <li>At stage 3 we have you, the human, learning to translate that thinking into a computer programming language like JavaScript; </li>
                <li>At stage 4, we have a computer program that translates JavaScript into 0's and 1's.</li>
                <li>And finally, at stage 5, we have the computer recieving the message as 0's and 1's.</li>

                <h2>Decomposition</h2>
                <p>Decomposition is the process of breaking a big problem (challenge or issue) into smaller and smaller parts until the problems are small enough that you can easily solve them.</p>
                <p>Then just focusing on each of the smaller problems until the bigger problem is solved.</p>
                <h4>Example 1: Party</h4>
                <p>Let's say we're throwing a party. There are many details to consider! Where and when will it be? Who will you invite? What will you serve? What will you wear?!</p>
                <p>Here, the big problem to solve is planning this party, and the invitations, venue, menu, music, all of those are smaller problems inside of a bigger problem. For now let's focus on sending out those invitations.</p>
                <h4>Example 2: eCommerce Site</h4>
                <p>Let's pretend we're working on the programming for an eCommerce site for a boutique. The client wants to be able to sort all the items by type (tops, skirts, pants, dresses, outerwear, and accessories), as well as by size, by color and by price. She also wants to build a custom checkout page, create pop-ups for all of her specials, and have a slide show on each product page.</p>
                <p>Woah! That's a lot. Rather than trying to solve all the problems at once, maybe just start with the sorting task.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-idea">
                <h2>Abstraction</h2>
                <p>Abstraction is a close cousin of decomposition. Once you've broken your problem into smaller parts, you can ask - which parts of the problem are absolutely necessary for me to solve it? And which can I leave out? Abstraction makes it possible for you to focus on what's necessary. In computer programming, less is more!</p>
                <h4>Example 1: Party</h4>
                <p>If you wanted to, you could go crazy with your invitations! What if you sent them all by balloon? Or carrier pigeon? And what if, when you opened up the invitation, it played a song and spouted confetti?</p>
                <p>You <em>could</em> do all of these, but at the end of the day, the task is much simpler. You need to get the date, time, and other essential information to your guests, and then they need to RSVP. Maybe. That's IT. Everything else is just unnecessary details!</p>
                <h4>Example 2: eCommerce Site</h4>
                <p>As you're thinking through how to sort all the items in the boutique, you may be tempted into thoughts like: &quot;What if the site can show tops AND skirts at the same time?&quot; or &quot;What if the tops could be sorted by sleeve length?!</p>
                <p>The challenge is - that's overkill! And all you really need to do is sort the things your client has listed. Start with the bare minimum that you need to do - it'll be complicated enough.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-idea">
                <h2>Pattern Recognition</h2>
                <p>It is possible that your method for solving ONE small problem could solve another one. This is where you look at all the small problems and see if there are any commonalities.</p>
                <h4>Example 1: Party</h4>
                <p>To figure out the best way to send your invitation to LOTS of people, test out how it works with one person first. That way, you can find out if there is a glitch with your e-invitation service, or how long it takes to prep and send something by snail mail.</p>
                <h4>Example 2: eCommerce Site</h4>
                <p>There are so many ways you need to sort the items in the boutique! Before trying to do it for everything, start by doing it for one of the properties - say color. Doing this will help you learn important lessons that you can apply to filtering by other properties.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-idea">
                <h2>Algorithm Writing</h2>
                <p>Once you have broken your BIG problem down into smaller problems, looked for similarities between the problems, removed all extraneous details...it's time for Algorithm Writing!</p>
                <p>In reality, writing an algorithm is much simpler than it sounds. It just means writing a series of instructions that explain how to solve a problem. Although algorithms are used a TON in computer programming, an algorithm doesn't need to be written in code to be an algorithm. In fact, any set of instructions - a recipe, a knitting pattern, a set of directions for how to assemble your IKEA dresser - those are all examples of algorithms that we encounter every day.</p>
                <h4>Example 1: Party</h4>
                <p>Let's say you've decided to send your invitations by Evite. Your algorithm could read something like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Determine Guest List, which only needs
                            <li>Name</li>
                            <li>Email</li>
                        </li>
                        <li>Determine Date, Time and Venue. (Including address) for party</li>
                        <li>In Evite, choose a design that suits your party</li>
                        <li>Add the Date, Time and Venue to the Evite</li>
                        <li>Send Evite to everyone on the Guest List</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>Example 2: eCommerce Site</h4>
                <p>Once you've figured out how to sort by color, you can write an algorithm that you can apply to your other filters. Its instructions could read something like this (but of course the actual instructions would be in code:)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color options: Black, Red, White</li>
                        <li>When a user selects a color option, the page displays items tagged with that color.</li>
                    </ul>
                <a href="https://learn.skillcrush.com/module-2/four-fundamental-principles-of-computational-thinking/" target="_blank"><p>But then of course the actual instructions would be in javascript, like this.</p></a>

              <h2>The Peanut Butter Sandwich Problem</h2>
              <p>Time to get a computer to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich!</p>
              <p>Here's the issue - the computer knows basically...nothing. It doesn't know what bread is, what peanut butter is, what jelly is, or how to spread the peanut butter, how to use a knife or even what a knife is.</p>
              <p>We'll start with the four priciples of computational thinking.</p>
              <h4>Decomposition - Let's break this big problem down into smaller problems.</h4>
                  <ol>
                      <li>Let's list out all of the ingredients and tools we need:
                          <ul>
                              <li>peanut butter</li>
                              <li>jelly</li>
                              <li>bread</li>
                              <li>knife</li>
                              <li>plate</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Then we'll talk about all the actions that need to be taken:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Open all the containers</li>
                              <li>Open the bread bag</li>
                              <li>Take out two slices of bread</li>
                              <li>Open the peanut butter jar</li>
                              <li>Open the jelly jar</li>
                              <li>Dip the knife into the peanut butter</li>
                              <li>Spread the peanut butter on the bread</li>
                              <li>Dip the knife into the jelly</li>
                              <li>Spread the jelly on the other piece of bread</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Let's pick one of those problems and see what we can do.</p>

              <h2>Pattern Recognition</h2>
              <p>First, let's look for some patterns. Are there any aspects of the list of actions we made that are repetitive?</p>
              <p>Yup! Opening the peanut putter jar and jelly jar, and spreading the peanut butter and spreading the jelly.</p>
              <p>If we figure these out for peanut butter, then we can use the same methods for jelly.</p>
              <h2>Abstraction</h2>
              <p>If you were to turn a PB & J into a math equation, it would be something like this: <strong>PB&amp;J = Peanut Butter + Jelly + Bread</strong></p>
              <p>But of course, putting peanut butter, jelly and bread together doesn't necessarily make a sandwich. There are lots of other details and assumptions that we're leaving out. For example, what kind of bread are we using? Is it gluten free? What about the peanut butter? Is it creamy or crunchy? And tell me about the jelly. Strawberry, jams or preserves...</p>
              <p>There's lots to think about, but not right now because we are going to solve a simplified version of the problem. And in fact, that is the hardest thing about abstraction - leaving out all of those details.</p>
              <p>There's one more thing abstraction can help us with here: checking our assumptions. Assumptions are tricky.</p>
              <p>We can't assume the computer knows anything. But in abstraction, you sometimes have to make some assumptions in order to solve one small part of the problem. So while trying to think through one part of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich - like how to spread peanut butter or jelly - you may want to make some assumptions like:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>The computer knows what a knife is</li>
                  <li>The computer knows how to open jars</li>
                  <li>The bread isn't in a bag</li>
                  <li>The bread is sliced</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Writing out</strong> assumptions like these will help you figure out how to solve the spreading problem.</p>
              <p>For example, if we assume the computer knows what a knife is, we no longer need to define it right this second, which make our problem a bit easier to solve. Then you can focus on defining the knife later, when it's time to do that.</p>
              <h2>Algorithm Writing</h2>
              <p>Now it's finally time to write that algorithm to teach the computer how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And by algorithms, I just mean that you need to write out instructions for the comupter for how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.</p>

              <h2>LOLCat Clock + Logic</h2>
              <p>Let's make a cat clock!</p>
              <p>Today, we're going to plan the logic of the most basic form of this algorithm.</p>
              <p>As we think through the LOLCat Clock, we'll think about the four priciples: Decomposition, Abstraction, Pattern Recognition and Algorithm Writing</p>
              <p>When it's time to write the algorithm, there's one thing we need to know about: Logic.</p>
              <p>Let's say we want our LOLCat Clock to say &quot;Good morning!&quot; in the morning and &quot;Good day!&quot; any other time of day. Our instructions might read something like this:</p>
              <h4>IF it's morning THEN say &quot;good morning!&quot; IF it's NOT morning THEN say &quot;good day!&quot;</h4>
              <p>Meaning if &quot;this clause&quot; is true then do &quot;X&quot;, or if it's not morning, IF &quot;this clause&quot; is not true then do &quot;Y&quot;.</p>
              <p>This is pretty close to how logic is expressed by computers. Only instead of saying &quot;IF NOT&quot;, computers say &quot;ELSE&quot;.</p>
              <p>IF it's morning, THEN say &quot;good morning!&quot; ELSE say &quot; "good day!" Where ELSE means any time it's not morning.</p>
              <p>Along with logic, computers also really like numbers. <strong>So even though a computer might not know what morning is, it does know numerical representations of time.</strong></p>
              <p>So instead of asking whether it's morning or not, you may find it's easier just to ask if the time is less than 12, like this:</p>
              <p>IF the time is less than 12pm, THEN say &quot;good morning!&quot;</p>
              <p>Which you could also express using the &quot;less than&quot; sympbol.</p>
              <p>IF the time is &lt; 12 pm then say &quot;good morning!&quot;</p>
              <h4>To recap...</h4>
              <p>Computers LOVE logic, which means they love it when you give them instructions like, &quot;IF X THEN do Y and ELSE do Z.&quot;</p>
              <p><strong>IF</strong> and <strong>ElSE</strong> are common computer keywords found in every programming language, so learn to love 'em! They also love numbers - adding them, comparing them, you name it! <strong>So whenever possible, translate your logic into numbers.</strong></p>

              <h2>LOLCat Clock Plan</h2>
              <p>We gonna b working on this throughout the whole class! So get comf. An LOLCat Clock is a website that delivers a different LOLCat-themed message to a user depending on what time of day the user visits the site.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> We'll write the logic for the basic functionality of the clock for a few time values: when it's morning, when it's evening and when it's afternoon.</li>
                  <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> We'll translate our work into actual JavaScript and add a few more time variables.</li>
                  <li><strong>Part 3:</strong> We'll connect our JavaScript to some HTML &amp; CSS, and add a button and some images while we're at it.</li>

              <h2>LOLCat Clock and the Four Priciples of Computational Thinking</h2>
              <p>As we start to think through the logic of the LOLCat clock, keep the Four Priciples of Computational Thinking in mind:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> How can we break this big problem down into a bunch of smaller problems? What are the pieces you need to know?</li>
                <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Once we've created a bunch of smaller problems, how can we make those problems as simple as possible?</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Which of the smaller problems are similar or repetitive?</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithm Writing:</strong> How can the essential aspects of your solution be translated into instructions?</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="main-idea">
              <h2>LOLCat Logic 101: IF &amp; ELSE</h2>
              <p>In this first part, we'll focus on the logic needed to make the clock work. <strong>The key principles</strong> at work for your LOLCat Clock are <strong>IF and ELSE</strong>.</p>
              <p>In order to work properly, the LOLCat website needs to deliver a different message to the user depending on what time it is. To start, if it's morning, the LOLCat will say something like &quot;Good morning!&quot; If it's NOT morning it will say something like, &quot;Good day!&quot;</p>
              <p>If we were to write out instructions for how to do that we might write something like this:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>IF it's morning, THEN say &quot;Good morning!&quot; In other words, if &quot;this clause&quot; is true, then do X.</li>
                  <li>IF it's NOT morning, THEN say &quot;Good day!&quot; In other words, if &quot;this clause&quot; is NOT true then do Y.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This is pretty close to how logic is expressed by computers. But instead of saying &quot;IF NOT&quot; computers prefer another keyword: ELSE. So the computer would express the same idea like so:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>IF it's morning, THEN say &quot;Good morning!&quot;</li>
                  <li>ELSE say &quot;Good day!&quot; Here, ELSE means all instances other than it being morning.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

              <div class="main-idea">
                <h2>LOLCat Logic &amp; Numbers</h2>
                <p>In addition to logic, another thing that computers like to do when it comes to logic is compare numerical values.</p>
                <p>In order for the computer to know what afternoon is, you need to define it using numerical terms. First you need to know what time it is, which is expressed as numbers. <strong>Then you can find out whether the time is equal to, greater than, or less than</strong> the time value that you've set to be the morning. To set that, you can write something like this:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>IF the time is less than 12 pm, then say &quot;Good morning!&quot;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A computer would express this same direction like this:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>IF the time &lt; 12 THEN say &quot;Good morning!&quot;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, if it's 9am the LOLCat might say &quot;Good morning!&quot; If it's afternoon it could say &quot;Good Afternoon!&quot;</p>
                <p>Today, our job is to plan the logic of this algorithm, and to think through the four principles of computational thinking as you do.</p>
