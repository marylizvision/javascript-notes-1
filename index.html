                <p>It's been a journey - trust me, I didn't want to use the word &quot;journey&quot;...but truly, that's what it's been. I've been learning computer programming from the fabtastic Skillcrush, mixed with w3 schools, and lots and lots and lots of repetition.</p>
                <p>I've been learning how I learn, and slowly but surely becoming more and more confident with each week. (Not each day - there are far too many ups and downs to say each day I've improved!)</p>

            <h2>Computational Thinking</h2>
            <h6>Think like a computer...</h6>
            <p>Computational Thinking is the term used to describe what it means to think like a computer. And Computational Thinking is all about using the specific and unique capabilities of computers to solve problems. Humans have the ability to think in gray areas and feelings and make complex connecions. Computers think in terms of math and logic, 0s and 1s. Computers have a skillset, and learning to think like one (simpler) will help you know how to use it better!</p>
            <p>Computers are a funny contradiction because they are both incredibly powerful and unbelievably simple. But in order to access their power, you first need to understand their limitations. (Learning to think like a programmer.) The main limitation is that computers really only understand zeros and ones. This is really different from how our brains work. Javascript and other programming languages are like the translators between your human thoughts and what the computer understands. So what I need to do is learn how to simplify my thinking (LOL OKAY) so I can begin to speak to the computer in terms it can understand. (WILL I FINALLY OVERCOME MY CHRONIC OVERTHINKING? IS THIS THE ANSWER?)</p>

            <h2>The Four Priciples of Computational Thinking:</h2>
            <h4>Decomposition, Abstraction, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithm Writing</h4>
            <p>Before writing any code, these priciples will help you think through your problem in a computational way.</p>
            <h4>Decomposition</h4>
            <p>The process of breaking down one big problem into smaller and smaller ones until all the problems are small and easy enough to solve. Ask yourself questions to the problems you're trying to solve. This reminds me of depression and when you're trying to defeat it - break down tasks, no matter how small already into even smaller tasks. Put one foot on the floor, the other, stand up, walk to the bathroom, etc. Work up momentum!</p>
            <h4>Pattern Recognition</h4>
            <p>After breaking down your problems into smaller problems, think to see if any of your smaller problems have ny commonalities, or if you can use similar methods to solve them. Just like when you learn how something works, you may be able to repeat the process for similar things. Rinse and repeat!</p>
            <h4>Abstraction</h4>
            <p>In abstraction, the goal is to omit specific details and to focus on the general patterns (OOH this is like when starting work on a drawing or painting - abstracting it helps see the bigger picture, the bigger shapes that contain the smaller shapes and details!) In other words, my task is to solve a very simplified version of the problem you're trying to solve. In a party invitation example, you're going to send out invitations. You decide who's going to be invited, write out the addresses, prepare them to be mailed, etc. But there are certain things you don't need to know in order to send out your <strong>test</strong> invitation. You don't need to know the date, time or place. It's just a test! Just making sure it works is most important.</p>
            <h4>Algorithm Writing</h4>
            <p>In reality, writing an algorithm is much simpler than it sounds (sweet). It just means writing a series of instructions that explain how to solve a problem. Although algorithms are used a ton in computer programming, any set of instructions - A recipe, a knitting pattern, a set of instructions for how to assemble your IKEA dresser - are all algorithms we encounter every day.</p>

            <h2>5 Stages of Communicating with Computers</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>At stage 1 we have you, the human being, thinking big, complex thoughts;</li>
                <li>At stage 2 we have you, the human, learning how to think like a computer; this is called computational thinking!</li>
                <li>At stage 3 we have you, the human, learning to translate that thinking into a computer programming language like JavaScript; </li>
                <li>At stage 4, we have a computer program that translates JavaScript into 0's and 1's.</li>
                <li>And finally, at stage 5, we have the computer recieving the message as 0's and 1's.</li>

                <h2>Decomposition</h2>
                <p>Decomposition is the process of breaking a big problem (challenge or issue) into smaller and smaller parts until the problems are small enough that you can easily solve them.</p>
                <p>Then just focusing on each of the smaller problems until the bigger problem is solved.</p>
                <h4>Example 1: Party</h4>
                <p>Let's say we're throwing a party. There are many details to consider! Where and when will it be? Who will you invite? What will you serve? What will you wear?!</p>
                <p>Here, the big problem to solve is planning this party, and the invitations, venue, menu, music, all of those are smaller problems inside of a bigger problem. For now let's focus on sending out those invitations.</p>
                <h4>Example 2: eCommerce Site</h4>
                <p>Let's pretend we're working on the programming for an eCommerce site for a boutique. The client wants to be able to sort all the items by type (tops, skirts, pants, dresses, outerwear, and accessories), as well as by size, by color and by price. She also wants to build a custom checkout page, create pop-ups for all of her specials, and have a slide show on each product page.</p>
                <p>Woah! That's a lot. Rather than trying to solve all the problems at once, maybe just start with the sorting task.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-idea">
                <h2>Abstraction</h2>
                <p>Abstraction is a close cousin of decomposition. Once you've broken your problem into smaller parts, you can ask - which parts of the problem are absolutely necessary for me to solve it? And which can I leave out? Abstraction makes it possible for you to focus on what's necessary. In computer programming, less is more!</p>
                <h4>Example 1: Party</h4>
                <p>If you wanted to, you could go crazy with your invitations! What if you sent them all by balloon? Or carrier pigeon? And what if, when you opened up the invitation, it played a song and spouted confetti?</p>
                <p>You <em>could</em> do all of these, but at the end of the day, the task is much simpler. You need to get the date, time, and other essential information to your guests, and then they need to RSVP. Maybe. That's IT. Everything else is just unnecessary details!</p>
                <h4>Example 2: eCommerce Site</h4>
                <p>As you're thinking through how to sort all the items in the boutique, you may be tempted into thoughts like: &quot;What if the site can show tops AND skirts at the same time?&quot; or &quot;What if the tops could be sorted by sleeve length?!</p>
                <p>The challenge is - that's overkill! And all you really need to do is sort the things your client has listed. Start with the bare minimum that you need to do - it'll be complicated enough.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-idea">
                <h2>Pattern Recognition</h2>
                <p>It is possible that your method for solving ONE small problem could solve another one. This is where you look at all the small problems and see if there are any commonalities.</p>
                <h4>Example 1: Party</h4>
                <p>To figure out the best way to send your invitation to LOTS of people, test out how it works with one person first. That way, you can find out if there is a glitch with your e-invitation service, or how long it takes to prep and send something by snail mail.</p>
                <h4>Example 2: eCommerce Site</h4>
                <p>There are so many ways you need to sort the items in the boutique! Before trying to do it for everything, start by doing it for one of the properties - say color. Doing this will help you learn important lessons that you can apply to filtering by other properties.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-idea">
                <h2>Algorithm Writing</h2>
                <p>Once you have broken your BIG problem down into smaller problems, looked for similarities between the problems, removed all extraneous details...it's time for Algorithm Writing!</p>
                <p>In reality, writing an algorithm is much simpler than it sounds. It just means writing a series of instructions that explain how to solve a problem. Although algorithms are used a TON in computer programming, an algorithm doesn't need to be written in code to be an algorithm. In fact, any set of instructions - a recipe, a knitting pattern, a set of directions for how to assemble your IKEA dresser - those are all examples of algorithms that we encounter every day.</p>
                <h4>Example 1: Party</h4>
                <p>Let's say you've decided to send your invitations by Evite. Your algorithm could read something like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Determine Guest List, which only needs
                            <li>Name</li>
                            <li>Email</li>
                        </li>
                        <li>Determine Date, Time and Venue. (Including address) for party</li>
                        <li>In Evite, choose a design that suits your party</li>
                        <li>Add the Date, Time and Venue to the Evite</li>
                        <li>Send Evite to everyone on the Guest List</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>Example 2: eCommerce Site</h4>
                <p>Once you've figured out how to sort by color, you can write an algorithm that you can apply to your other filters. Its instructions could read something like this (but of course the actual instructions would be in code:)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color options: Black, Red, White</li>
                        <li>When a user selects a color option, the page displays items tagged with that color.</li>
                    </ul>
                <a href="https://learn.skillcrush.com/module-2/four-fundamental-principles-of-computational-thinking/" target="_blank"><p>But then of course the actual instructions would be in javascript, like this.</p></a>

              <h2>The Peanut Butter Sandwich Problem</h2>
              <p>Time to get a computer to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich!</p>
              <p>Here's the issue - the computer knows basically...nothing. It doesn't know what bread is, what peanut butter is, what jelly is, or how to spread the peanut butter, how to use a knife or even what a knife is.</p>
              <p>We'll start with the four priciples of computational thinking.</p>
              <h4>Decomposition - Let's break this big problem down into smaller problems.</h4>
                  <ol>
                      <li>Let's list out all of the ingredients and tools we need:
                          <ul>
                              <li>peanut butter</li>
                              <li>jelly</li>
                              <li>bread</li>
                              <li>knife</li>
                              <li>plate</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Then we'll talk about all the actions that need to be taken:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Open all the containers</li>
                              <li>Open the bread bag</li>
                              <li>Take out two slices of bread</li>
                              <li>Open the peanut butter jar</li>
                              <li>Open the jelly jar</li>
                              <li>Dip the knife into the peanut butter</li>
                              <li>Spread the peanut butter on the bread</li>
                              <li>Dip the knife into the jelly</li>
                              <li>Spread the jelly on the other piece of bread</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Let's pick one of those problems and see what we can do.</p>

              <h2>Pattern Recognition</h2>
              <p>First, let's look for some patterns. Are there any aspects of the list of actions we made that are repetitive?</p>
              <p>Yup! Opening the peanut putter jar and jelly jar, and spreading the peanut butter and spreading the jelly.</p>
              <p>If we figure these out for peanut butter, then we can use the same methods for jelly.</p>
              <h2>Abstraction</h2>
              <p>If you were to turn a PB & J into a math equation, it would be something like this: <strong>PB&amp;J = Peanut Butter + Jelly + Bread</strong></p>
              <p>But of course, putting peanut butter, jelly and bread together doesn't necessarily make a sandwich. There are lots of other details and assumptions that we're leaving out. For example, what kind of bread are we using? Is it gluten free? What about the peanut butter? Is it creamy or crunchy? And tell me about the jelly. Strawberry, jams or preserves...</p>
              <p>There's lots to think about, but not right now because we are going to solve a simplified version of the problem. And in fact, that is the hardest thing about abstraction - leaving out all of those details.</p>
              <p>There's one more thing abstraction can help us with here: checking our assumptions. Assumptions are tricky.</p>
              <p>We can't assume the computer knows anything. But in abstraction, you sometimes have to make some assumptions in order to solve one small part of the problem. So while trying to think through one part of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich - like how to spread peanut butter or jelly - you may want to make some assumptions like:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>The computer knows what a knife is</li>
                  <li>The computer knows how to open jars</li>
                  <li>The bread isn't in a bag</li>
                  <li>The bread is sliced</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Writing out</strong> assumptions like these will help you figure out how to solve the spreading problem.</p>
              <p>For example, if we assume the computer knows what a knife is, we no longer need to define it right this second, which make our problem a bit easier to solve. Then you can focus on defining the knife later, when it's time to do that.</p>
              <h2>Algorithm Writing</h2>
              <p>Now it's finally time to write that algorithm to teach the computer how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And by algorithms, I just mean that you need to write out instructions for the comupter for how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.</p>

              <h2>LOLCat Clock + Logic</h2>
              <p>Let's make a cat clock!</p>
              <p>Today, we're going to plan the logic of the most basic form of this algorithm.</p>
              <p>As we think through the LOLCat Clock, we'll think about the four priciples: Decomposition, Abstraction, Pattern Recognition and Algorithm Writing</p>
              <p>When it's time to write the algorithm, there's one thing we need to know about: Logic.</p>
              <p>Let's say we want our LOLCat Clock to say &quot;Good morning!&quot; in the morning and &quot;Good day!&quot; any other time of day. Our instructions might read something like this:</p>
              <h4>IF it's morning THEN say &quot;good morning!&quot; IF it's NOT morning THEN say &quot;good day!&quot;</h4>
              <p>Meaning if &quot;this clause&quot; is true then do &quot;X&quot;, or if it's not morning, IF &quot;this clause&quot; is not true then do &quot;Y&quot;.</p>
              <p>This is pretty close to how logic is expressed by computers. Only instead of saying &quot;IF NOT&quot;, computers say &quot;ELSE&quot;.</p>
              <p>IF it's morning, THEN say &quot;good morning!&quot; ELSE say &quot; "good day!" Where ELSE means any time it's not morning.</p>
              <p>Along with logic, computers also really like numbers. <strong>So even though a computer might not know what morning is, it does know numerical representations of time.</strong></p>
              <p>So instead of asking whether it's morning or not, you may find it's easier just to ask if the time is less than 12, like this:</p>
              <p>IF the time is less than 12pm, THEN say &quot;good morning!&quot;</p>
              <p>Which you could also express using the &quot;less than&quot; sympbol.</p>
              <p>IF the time is &lt; 12 pm then say &quot;good morning!&quot;</p>
              <h4>To recap...</h4>
              <p>Computers LOVE logic, which means they love it when you give them instructions like, &quot;IF X THEN do Y and ELSE do Z.&quot;</p>
              <p><strong>IF</strong> and <strong>ElSE</strong> are common computer keywords found in every programming language, so learn to love 'em! They also love numbers - adding them, comparing them, you name it! <strong>So whenever possible, translate your logic into numbers.</strong></p>

              <h2>LOLCat Clock Plan</h2>
              <p>We gonna b working on this throughout the whole class! So get comf. An LOLCat Clock is a website that delivers a different LOLCat-themed message to a user depending on what time of day the user visits the site.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> We'll write the logic for the basic functionality of the clock for a few time values: when it's morning, when it's evening and when it's afternoon.</li>
                  <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> We'll translate our work into actual JavaScript and add a few more time variables.</li>
                  <li><strong>Part 3:</strong> We'll connect our JavaScript to some HTML &amp; CSS, and add a button and some images while we're at it.</li>

              <h2>LOLCat Clock and the Four Priciples of Computational Thinking</h2>
              <p>As we start to think through the logic of the LOLCat clock, keep the Four Priciples of Computational Thinking in mind:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> How can we break this big problem down into a bunch of smaller problems? What are the pieces you need to know?</li>
                <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Once we've created a bunch of smaller problems, how can we make those problems as simple as possible?</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Which of the smaller problems are similar or repetitive?</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithm Writing:</strong> How can the essential aspects of your solution be translated into instructions?</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="main-idea">
              <h2>LOLCat Logic 101: IF &amp; ELSE</h2>
              <p>In this first part, we'll focus on the logic needed to make the clock work. <strong>The key principles</strong> at work for your LOLCat Clock are <strong>IF and ELSE</strong>.</p>
              <p>In order to work properly, the LOLCat website needs to deliver a different message to the user depending on what time it is. To start, if it's morning, the LOLCat will say something like &quot;Good morning!&quot; If it's NOT morning it will say something like, &quot;Good day!&quot;</p>
              <p>If we were to write out instructions for how to do that we might write something like this:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>IF it's morning, THEN say &quot;Good morning!&quot; In other words, if &quot;this clause&quot; is true, then do X.</li>
                  <li>IF it's NOT morning, THEN say &quot;Good day!&quot; In other words, if &quot;this clause&quot; is NOT true then do Y.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This is pretty close to how logic is expressed by computers. But instead of saying &quot;IF NOT&quot; computers prefer another keyword: ELSE. So the computer would express the same idea like so:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>IF it's morning, THEN say &quot;Good morning!&quot;</li>
                  <li>ELSE say &quot;Good day!&quot; Here, ELSE means all instances other than it being morning.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

              <div class="main-idea">
                <h2>LOLCat Logic &amp; Numbers</h2>
                <p>In addition to logic, another thing that computers like to do when it comes to logic is compare numerical values.</p>
                <p>In order for the computer to know what afternoon is, you need to define it using numerical terms. First you need to know what time it is, which is expressed as numbers. <strong>Then you can find out whether the time is equal to, greater than, or less than</strong> the time value that you've set to be the morning. To set that, you can write something like this:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>IF the time is less than 12 pm, then say &quot;Good morning!&quot;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A computer would express this same direction like this:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>IF the time &lt; 12 THEN say &quot;Good morning!&quot;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, if it's 9am the LOLCat might say &quot;Good morning!&quot; If it's afternoon it could say &quot;Good Afternoon!&quot;</p>
                <p>Today, our job is to plan the logic of this algorithm, and to think through the four principles of computational thinking as you do.</p>

              <h2>Flowcharts</h2>
              <p>Flowcharts are a great way to plot out algorithms, especially if it needs to output different results along the way. And they often use a standard set of styling conventions:</p>
              <p>A <strong>start/stop</strong> to mark the start and stop of the algorithm which is a <em>rounded rectangle</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>Process block</strong> for an instruction or command which is a <em>rectangle</em>.</p>
              <p>A <strong>decision diamond</strong> for either a yes or no, which is a <em>diamond.</em></p>
              <p>An <strong>input/output parallelogram</strong> for either input the computer receives or output the computer provides.</p>
              <p><strong>Circles</strong> to connect one point in the algorithm to another, if needed. (If theres a connection point or turn that needs to be made in order to show it's bypassing or connecting to another point.)</p>
              <p><strong>Arrows</strong> indicate the way the algorithm flows.</p>
              <p>Whether you're making your flowchart in a computer or by hand, using these conventions will help to communicate what's happening at each stage.</p>
              <h4>Translating from logical statements into a flowchart</h4>
              <p>Here's an example of a logical statement followed by its flowchart translation:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>IF you want to adopt a pet, THEN go to a local shelter.</li>
                  <li>IF you meet your animal soul mate at the shelter, THEN adopt her!</li>
                  <li>ELSE go home.</li>

              <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
              <p>Pseudocode is a pay of simplifying your instructions so that they read more like code. It's a middleground to help you understand the problem better and the way you can go about solving it. Of course, pseudocode won't work on a computer, but it helps guide you towards that.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>There is no 100% right way to write pseudocode</li>
                  <li>There are no hard and fast rules so just keep doing the thing and it'll work out!</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Although you can pretty much write whatever you want, here are a few keywords you should be using:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>IF - THEN - ELSE: These are all keywords you are already using! And the purpose of these keywords is to indicate an if/then/else statement.</li>
                  <li>INPUT: is for data a user or another source will be giving to the computer.</li>
                  <li>OUTPUT: is used to indicate the end result of a series of commands.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>And why use these keywords? Because they are very similar to the types of keywords you'll use when you write code.</p>

              <h2>Pseudocode &amp; Variables</h2>
              <p>Variables are stand-ins for some value, just like they were in algebra in school: <em>x = y + 8, if y = 2, solve for x</em></p>
              <p>But unlike algebra where the answer is always a number, in programming variables can be different things - like words or even chunks of code.</p>
              <p>Also, unlike algebra, in programming, the value of variables can change depending on where you are in the script. They may start as one value, and end up a totally different value later!</p>
              <p>Let's say you're making a clock, and you need a variable for the current time of day. The value is changing constantly! But the variable remains the same.</p>
              <p>Now let's look at a variation of our LOLCat clock and try writing it out in pseudocode:</p>
              <div class="code">
                  <p>INPUT computer finds out what time it is</p>
                  <p>STORE time in the TIME variable</p>
                  <p>IF TIME &lt; 12pm
                  <p class="indent-40">OUTPUT message: &quot;Good morning!!&quot;</p>
                  <p>ELSE</p>
                  <p class="indent-40">OUTPUT message: &quot;Good day!&quot;</p>
              </div>

              <h2>Pseudocode Terms</h2>
              <p>We may not understand what all of these terms mean right now, but just think about how you might use them as they will help us translate our pseudocode into JavaScript.</p>
              <h4>STOP/END</h4>
                  <p>The first thing you need to know is that you need to tell your computer when a statement or instruction is done. Similar to when you stick in a period or make a new paragraph - computers are so literal that you have to spell it out for them. Which means that if you create a loop or a function or an if/else statement you have to tell the computer when that statement is DONE. And you do that by writing either STOP or END. Whichever one works for you!</p>
              <h4>IF/THEN/ELSE</h4>
                  <p>Computers often think in terms of &quot;if x happens, then do y, if not do Z.&quot; In pseudocode, you represent this idea using IF, THEN, ELSE.</p>
                  <div class="code">
                      <p>IF time is known THEN</p>
                      <p class="indent-40">OUTPUT message: &quot;Good day, mate!&quot;</p>
                      <p>ELSE</p>
                      <p class="indent-40">OUTPUT &quot;I'm not sure what time it is. Good day anyway!&quot;</p>
                      <p>STOP</p>
                  </div>
              <h4>INPUT/OUTPUT</h4>
                  <p>It's not uncommon for some parts of code to require an input in order to run, and to create an output as a result. This idea comes up a lot in writing functions, something you'll be doing all the time in JavaScript. You can express inputs and outputs in pseudocode like this:</p>
                  <div class="code">
                      <p>INPUT time</p>
                      <p class="indent-20">IF time is known</p>
                      <p class="indent-40">IF time is before noon THEN</p>
                      <p class="indent-80">OUTPUT message: &quot;Good morning!&quot;</p>
                      <p class="indent-40">ELSE IF time is after evening THEN</p>
                      <p class="indent-80">OUTPUT message: &quot;Good evening!&quot;</p>
                      <p class="indent-40">ELSE</p>
                      <p class="indent-80">OUTPUT message: &quot;Good afternoon!&quot;</p>
                      <p class="indent-40">STOP</p>
                      <p class="indent-20">ELSE</p>
                      <p class="indent-40">OUTPUT &quot;I'm not sure what time it is. Good day anyway!&quot;</p>
                      <p class="indent-20">STOP</p>
                  </div>
              <h4>STORE/SAVE</h4>
                  <p>STORE is a pseudocode term that tells your computer when it needs to store or save a value. Let's say you had a form field where you could input your name, and then it would output a message with your name on it. In between inputting and outputting your name, you want to save your name.</p>
                  <p><em>(I know this seems silly and unnecessary! Why doesn't the computer know to store the value? Well...it doesn't! So make sure to tell it to do it.)</em></p>
                  <p>The pseudocode for telling the computer to store something would look like this:</p>
                  <div class="code">
                      <p>INPUT name &quot;Jane Doesitall&quot;</p>
                      <p>STORE name</p>
                      <p>OUTPUT message: &quot;Hello [name]! Welcome to our website!&quot;</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>You can also use STORE if you want a certain value to change. Like, say you always have a favorite dress, but which dress is your favorite depends on what season it is. Your pseudocode might look something like this:</p>
                  <div class="code">
                      <p>STORE favorite dress</p>
                      <p>STORE season</p>
                      <p>IF season IS summer</p>
                      <p class="indent-40">favorite dress IS blue dress with spaghetti straps</p>
                      <p>ELSE IF season IS fall</p>
                      <p class="indent-40">favorite dress IS maroon dress with three-quarter sleeves</p>
                      <p>ELSE IF season IS winter</p>
                      <p class="indent-40">favorite dress IS grey sweater dress</p>
                      <p>ELSE IF season IS spring</p>
                      <p class="indent-40">favorite dress IS cap-sleeved purple dress</p>
                      <p>STOP</p>
                  </div>
                  <h4>Some notes about indenting</h4>
                  <p>When writing pseudocode - not to mention JavaScript - you may want to format your lines using indentation.</p>
                  <p>Indentation helps you to be able to see what's in your pseudocode more clearly. It's not necessary, but it's super helpful - not only for you, but for other people reading your code.</p>

                                 <li>ELSE just go to work and drink some work coffee.</li>
                              </ul>
                          </li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
              </ul>
              <p>As a flow chart, it would look something like this:</p>
              <img src="img/coffeeshop-flowchart-3.png" alt="coffeeshop flowchart">
              <p>And as pseudocode, it would read like this:</p>
              <div class="code">
                  <p class="space-below">START</p>
                  <p>IF Joe's is not too busy THEN</p>
                  <p class="indent-40">Go to Joe's</p>
                  <p class="indent-40">OUTPUT Get an almond milk latte from Joe's!</p>
                  <p>ELSE IF Joe's is too busy THEN</p>
                  <p class="indent-40">Go to Mighty Bean.</p>
                  <p class="indent-40">IF Mighty Bean isn't too busy THEN</p>
                  <p class="indent-80">OUTPUT Get an almond latte.</p>
                  <p class="indent-40">ELSE</p>
                  <p class="indent-80">Go to work</p>
                  <p class="indent-80">OUTPUT drink work coffee.</p>
                  <p class="space-above">STOP</p>
              </div>
              <p>There are some key things to notice here:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>The pseudocode is super similar to the instructions! It's just a little more condensed and codey.</li>
                  <li>Pseudocode, like flowcharts, often begins with a start and ends with a stop.</li>
                  <li>Pseudocode, like actual code, also uses indentation to keep it all straight.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Of course, you can write your pseudocode however you want! These are just some guidelines you can use to help keep your concepts straight.</p>
              <h4>Pseudocode &amp; Variables</h4>
              <p>There's one more thing to mention here: what if this pseudocode was using variables?</p>
              <p>There are two items in the above pseudocode that could be expressed as variables:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>The coffee shop</li>
                  <li>The beverage</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The value for each of these changes depending on what stage you're at in the process.</p>
              <p>Here's the same pseudocode as above, only now with our two variables:</p>
              <div class="code">
                  <p>STORE coffeeshop.</p>
                  <p>STORE beverage AS &quot;almond milk latte&quot;.</p>
                  <p class="space-above space-below">START</p>
                  <p>coffeeshop = Joe's.</p>
                  <p>IF coffeeshop is not too busy THEN</p>
                  <p class="indent-40">Go to coffeeshop.</p>
                  <p class="indent-40 space-below">OUTPUT Get a beverage from coffeeshop!</p>
                  <p>ELSE IF coffeeshop is too busy THEN</p>
                  <p class="indent-40">coffeeshop = Mighty Bean.</p>
                  <p class="indent-40">Go to coffeeshop.</p>
                  <p class="indent-40">IF coffeeshop isn't too busy THEN</p>
                  <p class="indent-80">OUTPUT Get beverage.</p>
                  <p class="indent-40">ELSE</p>
                  <p class="indent-80">Go to work</p>
                  <p class="indent-80">beverage = &quot;work coffee.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="indent-80 space-below">OUTPUT get beverage.</p>
                  <p>STOP</p>
              </div>
              <p>The variables are declared at the top using the pseudocode word <strong>STORE</strong>. In one case - <strong>coffeeshop</strong> - the value isn't assigned until the instructions get going. <strong>beverage</strong>, however, has been assigned the value &quot;almond milk latte&quot; - a value retains until almost the end of the code.</p>
              <p>It may feel silly to declare variables like this, but next week you'll be writing real JavaScript. And then, you'll really have to!</p>

              <h2>Objects</h2>
              <p>An object can be anything - a dog, a candy bar, a house. What we use to identify that thing are its <strong>properties</strong>.</p>
              <p>A House, for example, usually has properties like:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>An exterior</li>
                  <li>A roof</li>
                  <li>Number of stories</li>
                  <li>Number of bedrooms</li>
                  <li>Number of bathrooms</li>
                  <li>Number of other rooms</li>
              </ul>
              <p>And so on.</p>
              <p>(Of course actual houses have a lot more properties than this, but we're abstracting here!)</p>
              <p>As many properties as houses generally share, many of them are quite different! Some are single story, some are multi-story, some are wood, some are brick. But as many variations as there are, we still understand the concept of a house and the properties it <em>usually</em> has. So like, there are usually always, bedrooms, bathrooms, a roof, an exterior etc. But there can be more of course.</p>

              <h2>Objects, Properties and Values</h2>
              <p>Objects in JavaScript work in a similar way. You could have an object for a political candidate in an election, who could have properties like name and number of votes. The <strong>values</strong> for those properties may change based on who the candidate is, but the candidate object remains the same.</p>
              <p>Political candidate Robin (<strong>property</strong> = name <strong>Value</strong> = Robin) 50 votes (<strong>Property</strong> = votes <strong>Value</strong> = 50)</p>
              <p>Let's say you were to write out a house object in pseudocode. It could look something like this:</p>
              <div class="code">
                  <p>OBJECT House</p>
                  <div class="indent-40">
                      <p>PROPERTY exterior</p>
                      <p>PROPERTY paint color</p>
                      <p>PROPERTY roof</p>
                      <p>PROPERTY stories</p>
                      <p>PROPERTY bedrooms</p>
                      <p>PROPERTY bathrooms</p>
                      <p>PROPERTY other rooms</p>
                  </div>
              </div>
              <p>When you call a new instance of that object, you can give it new values - like the kind of exterior, the kind of roof, the number of stories, and the number of different kinds of stories.</p>
              <p>Next up, you'll get some more practice indentifying properties!</p>
